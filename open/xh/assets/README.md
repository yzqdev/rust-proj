## Tools used to create xh-demo.gif
- [asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema) for the initial recording.
- [asciinema-edit](https://github.com/cirocosta/asciinema-edit) to speed up the recording.
- [asciicast2gif](https://github.com/asciinema/asciicast2gif) to produce the final GIF. The
  default font didn't look great so I modified it to use [Cascadia Mono](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).
